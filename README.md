# BeachFinder - My Neighborhood App

For my final project I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to create a single page application of the beaches in Seattle, WA. This app fetches data using the Google Maps Javascript API and FourSquare Places API to render a map with markers and infowindow of various beaches within the Seattle area.

## Running the App
- Install the lastest version of ``node`` and ``npm``
- Clone the repository with Git
- Install necessary project dependancies with ``npm install``
- Start development server by running ``npm run start``

To utilize the functionality of the service worker, you must run the app in production build. To run in production mode you may start the production server.
- ``npm run build``
- ``serve -s build``

## Project Dependencies
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Google Maps React](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react)
- [React Burger Menu](https://github.com/negomi/react-burger-menu)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Install Dependencies
In the project root, install dependencies.
``npm install axios``
``npm install react-burger-menu``
